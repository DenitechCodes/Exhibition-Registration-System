1. Input Validation
Input validation ensures the user enters correct and complete information before it is saved to the database.

a)Empty Fields Check
Before performing insert or update operations, we check that all important text fields are not empty. This prevents incomplete data from being inserted, which protects data integrity in the database.

b)Valid Email Format
We validate the email using a regular expression.This ensures the email follows a correct structure like user@example.com, avoiding invalid or unusable entries.



2. Ensuring Data Consistency Between GUI and Database
Data consistency means that what the user sees on the form matches what is stored in the database.

 a) Using PreparedStatement
All database operations (insert, update, search, delete) use PreparedStatement, which binds exact values from GUI components.This ensures accurate and secure data transfer without SQL injection risks or formatting errors.

b) Loading Data into GUI on Search
When a record is retrieved, values from the database are displayed in the form fields.This keeps the GUI in sync with the latest data stored in the database.

c) Image Path Consistency
When a user uploads or searches for a participant:
-The image path is saved or retrieved.
-The image is displayed in the JLabel.
This ensures visual consistency between stored image data and what's shown in the GUI.
